# Dc-characteristics
Simulation of Idvs Vgs,Vds characteristics using LTspice
# NMOS Characteristics using LTspice

This project is part of my basic electronics learning in the first semester.
The aim of this project is to understand the working of an NMOS transistor
and to study its characteristics using LTspice simulation.

## What I did
- Simulated NMOS transistor in LTspice
- Plotted ID vs VGS characteristics
- Plotted ID vs VDS characteristics
- Observed how drain current changes with gate and drain voltage

## Software Used
- LTspice
- Windows

## Description
An NMOS transistor is connected with separate voltage sources for VGS and VDS.
DC sweep analysis is performed to obtain the characteristic curves.

This helped me understand:
- Threshold voltage behavior
- Linear region
- Saturation region of NMOS operation

## Files in this repository
- `.asc` files: LTspice schematic files
- `.png` files: Output graphs from simulation

## Learning Outcome
This project helped me understand the basic operation of MOSFETs
and how simulations are used to verify theoretical concepts.
